# Finance Interviewer

I wanted to develop full-stack web application for finance interview preparation. 

The ambition is to provide an efficient and cheap solution for the little sharks ðŸ¦ˆ preparing for finance interviews, providing them with the best experience to rock them ðŸ”¥.

The webapp includes features such as ChatGPT-style interactive modes, session tracking, and a knowledge base powered by PDF uploads.
