# UiForm Outreach Assitant

The starting point was the following: as a Growth Engineer working to scale our great product at [UiForm](uiform.com), I wanted to reach out to **A LOT** of people. For this purpose, there are nice fee-paying existing Chrome extensions, but that poorly integrated in the sales outbound flow I had.

Problem — Analysis — Solution. 
My idea was to use our product and the extensions to create a frictionless flow and scale our sales outbound. 

I did a cool stuff, it worked. After 10s of sales meetings booked thanks to it, I share it to you.

It's simple, especially thanks to [UiForm](uiform.com) — go check it out, their product is brillant.
