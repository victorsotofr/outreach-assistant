# Outreach Assistant

> **VISIT** [**HERE**](https://outreach-assistant.vercel.app/)

The starting point: I needed to scale my outreach capacity in a smart way at [Retab](https://www.retab.com/).

Goal was to use my Google email adresses, but also student email adresses (via SMTP), and create a seamless flow adapted to my outreach strategy & habits.
